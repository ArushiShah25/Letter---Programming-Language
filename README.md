# Description
 Letter is a minimalistic, single-letter syntax language designed for efficient and compact code expression. Each command or keyword is represented by a single uppercase letter, reducing verbosity, increasing 
 speed and making the language intuitive for those familiar with foundational programming constructs. It comes with all the essentials: you can work with boolean logic, perform calculations 
 with numbers, and assign values to strings. You’ll find familiar tools like if-then-else statements and loops (for and while) to help structure your code. Whether 
 you’re doing simple math or comparing values, the language supports multiple data types like booleans, integers and strings. It’s designed to work smoothly on Windows, macOS, and Linux, 
 giving you the flexibility to code wherever you are.
