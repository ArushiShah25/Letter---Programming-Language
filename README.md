# Description
 ProLan2024 is built to make everyday coding tasks easier and more intuitive. It comes with all the essentials: you can work with boolean logic, perform calculations 
 with numbers, and assign values to strings. You’ll find familiar tools like if-then-else statements and loops (for and while) to help structure your code. Whether 
 you’re doing simple math or comparing values, the language supports multiple data types like booleans, integers, floats, and strings. We’ve used open-source tools 
 like ANTLR and Flex to bring it to life, and you can run your programs straight from the command line. It’s designed to work smoothly on Windows, macOS, and Linux, 
 giving you the flexibility to code wherever you are.
